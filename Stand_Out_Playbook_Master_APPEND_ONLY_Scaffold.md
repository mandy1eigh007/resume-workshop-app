**Note to Instructors:**

This scaffold is designed to be populated with trade-specific details for each supported trade. The app will:

1. Insert the existing Stand-Out Playbook content (Part 1)
2. Append the new sections (Part 2) with trade-specific data from content libraries
3. Export as DOCX for student use

Instructors can edit the generated document to add local program details, update calendars, or customize recommendations.
