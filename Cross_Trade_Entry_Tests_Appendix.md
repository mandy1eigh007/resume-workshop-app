### 3. Physical Capability Tests (PCT-Style)

**Common Elements:**
* Carries (e.g., 50 lb, 75 lb, 100 lb for specified distances)
* Lifts (floor to waist, waist to shoulder)
* Ladder climbs (specific heights, sometimes with weight)
* Balance and coordination tasks
* Sustained activity over time periods

**What to Practice:**
* Timed carries with proper body mechanics
* Safe lifting technique
* Ladder setup and climbing with control
* Endurance conditioning

**Metrics to Track:**
* Weights and distances achieved
* Times recorded
* Pass/fail on specific tasks
* PPE use documented
* Signed verification by assessor or instructor

**Prep Resource Labels:**
* "Timed Carry/Lift Plan"
* "Ladder Climb Readiness Practice"
* "Physical Conditioning for Trades"

### 4. Ladder/Pole Climb Assessments

**Common in:** High Voltage – Outside Lineman, Power Line Clearance Tree Trimmer, some Elevator Constructor programs

**Elements Assessed:**
* Height reached within time limit
* Control and positioning during ascent/descent
* Use of tie-in and positioning equipment (where applicable)
* Rest points and technique

**What to Practice:**
* Controlled climbing with proper grip and foot placement
* Timing practice to meet standards
* Building endurance for sustained climbs
* Safety checks and equipment use

**Metrics to Track:**
* Time to reach target height
* Control checks (smooth vs. rushed)
* Rest points needed
* Signed verification by qualified assessor

**Prep Resource Labels:**
* "Climb Readiness Training"
* "Pole Climbing Fundamentals (if applicable)"

---

## Verification Standards

**Who Can Verify:**
* Instructor at pre-apprenticeship or training program
* Supervisor or designated assessor
* Qualified assessor at testing facility

**What to Document:**
* Name and signature of verifier
* Date of assessment
* Specific metrics (time, weight, distance, score)
* Pass/fail or rating where applicable
* Contact information for verifier (optional but recommended)

---

## Prep Strategy by Timeline

### Weeks 0–2 (Awareness & Baseline)
* Identify which tests apply to target trade(s)
* Take baseline practice test (if available)
* Identify weak areas
* Begin study plan or physical conditioning

### Weeks 2–6 (Focused Practice)
* Daily or weekly practice sessions
* Track scores/times and improvements
* Work with tutor or instructor on weak areas
* Document practice with logs

### Weeks 6–12 (Refinement & Testing)
* Take full practice tests under timed conditions
* Refine weak areas
* Schedule official test (if applicable)
* Gather verification documents

---

## Common Resources (General Guidance)

* Public library tutoring and study rooms
* Community college basic skills courses
* Free online math and reasoning practice sites
* Pre-apprenticeship programs with embedded test prep
* Study groups with peers

---

## Notes on Employer-Specific Assessments

Some employers and programs use proprietary or customized tests. When possible:
* Request study guides or sample questions
* Ask about format and content areas
* Connect with recent applicants for insights (check program alumni)
* Document preparation efforts even if official practice materials are unavailable

---

## Privacy & Fairness

* All assessments should be documented with permission
* Accommodations may be available; check with program administrators
* No requirement to disclose scores publicly—only to programs as requested
