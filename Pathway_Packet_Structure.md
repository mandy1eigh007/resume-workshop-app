# Pathway Packet Structure

**Purpose:** Document the structure and sections of the Instructor Pathway Packet output.

**Overview:** The Pathway Packet is a trade-specific document provided to instructors and students. It includes existing trade-specific content from the Stand-Out Playbook plus new append-only sections that guide students through actionable next steps with proof artifact tracking.
