# North Star

**Purpose:** Equip pre-apprentices in Seattle tri-county to outperform the median applicant by delivering a one-page, evidence-driven resume and a Pathway Packet that includes a trade-specific Stand-Out Playbook and a proof-artifact tracker.

**Success criteria (what "good" looks like):**

* **Resume:** one page; ≤12 total skills; 3–4 measured bullets per job; normalized certifications; neutral wording.
* **Pathway Packet:** correct trade section intact, plus append-only "Do Next" steps (0–2, 2–6, 6–12 weeks), each with concrete proof artifacts students can attach.
* **Outcome tracking:** interviews reached, rank movement, time-to-offer, artifact count.

**Evidence doctrine:** If you can’t attach it (card, score, log, checklist, sign-off, face-free photo), it’s weak.

---

# Strategic Intent

**Stack provable signals fast, then deepen.**

* **0–2 weeks:** low/no-cost steps that prove safety habits, pace, and tool control.
* **2–6 weeks:** entry credentials + repetitive practice, captured as scores/logs.
* **6–12 weeks:** portfolio artifacts + an application rhythm that stays in motion.

**Score dimensions prioritized:** Safety • Pace/Production • Tool Control • Reading Prints/Specs • Communication.

---

# Problem to Solve

Hiring lists and apprenticeship rankings reward **proof**, not promises. Applicants arrive uneven; instructors need clean, audit-ready documentation. The app standardizes evidence and packages it cleanly for screeners and interview panels.

**Before/After coaching anchors:**

* Weak: "Hard worker; helped with materials."
  Strong: "Staged and moved 80 sheets of 5/8" drywall (32″×48″) with a team of 2 using carts; maintained clear egress; documented trip counts (12)."
* Weak: "Knows safety."
  Strong: "Wore PPE, used spotter for 30-ft ladder move, verified footing and 4:1 rule; logged pre-use inspection (date/initials)."

---

# Success (Definition of Done)

**Resume:** one page; measurable bullets; normalized certs; ≤12 skills; objective stays neutral.
**Pathway Packet:** correct trade content kept intact, new append-only blocks added; artifact tracker filled; checklists included.
**Red flags to prevent:** invented employers/dates; adjective-only bullets; sub-trade labels in objectives; union/non-union wording anywhere.

---

# Stakeholders (Voices Served)

* **Student:** wants a fair shot and "do next" steps that clearly move rank.
* **Instructor:** needs consistent documentation and artifacts for audit-ready files.
* **Screener:** wants fast evidence of safety, pace, and reliability in one page.

Tone guardrails: neutral, factual, crew-useful language.

---

# Evidence Philosophy

**Artifact types accepted:**

* **Cards/Certs:** OSHA Outreach (10/30), WA flagger (time-limited), CPR/First Aid, EPA 608 (if earned), employer evaluations (on-hire).
* **Scores/Logs:** quiz PDFs, practice timers, drill logs with timestamp.
* **Checklists:** drop-zone control, egress/protection, tool control layouts, ladder setup.
* **Face-free Photos:** labeled layouts, maintenance logs.
* **Sign-offs:** supervisor/instructor name, date, contact.

**Validity notes shown to users:**

* Flagger cards expire on a schedule—track your own date.
* Forklift competency is evaluated by the employer on the job; pre-hire classes are practice only.
* Where a credential never expires, keep the original proof accessible.

---

# Ranking Mechanics We Target

**Evidence→Rubric mapping:**

* **Safety/Compliance:** PPE logs; LOTO awareness sheet; flagger card; tailboard notes → **Artifacts:** checklist, card, signed form.
* **Pace/Production:** timed carry/stack counts; pick-rates; staging logs → **Artifacts:** stopwatch log, counts sheet.
* **Tool Control:** labeled layouts; pre-use inspections; torque/bit charts → **Artifacts:** photo (no faces), signed checklist.
* **Prints/Specs:** two nameplate/print read-throughs with answers → **Artifacts:** completed worksheet.
* **Communication:** hand-signal drill log; radio check log; brief JHA notes → **Artifacts:** initialed form.

# Geographic Intent (Seattle-First)

Seattle tri-county (King/Pierce/Snohomish) content comes first. Each trade includes a **Mobility Plan** subsection limited to legitimate calendars and reciprocity caveats for multi-state options.

---

# Equity Intent

**Low/No-cost first.** Where paid options exist, present public alternatives (open courses, library access, practice drills) so cost doesn’t block progress.

---

# Document Bundle (What the app outputs)

**Output 1 — One-Page Resume (content fields only):**

* **Header:** Name | City, State | Phone | Email
* **Objective:** one line, neutral; chosen from starter bank; optionally edited by student.
* **Experience (≤3):** Company, City/State, Dates, Title; 3–4 measured bullets (≤24 words).
* **Skills (≤12 total):** Transferable • Job-Specific • Self-Management.
* **Certifications:** normalized names only.
* **Education (≤2):** School, Credential, Year, Details.

**Output 2 — Instructor Pathway Packet (per trade):**
Existing content remains intact, then append:

1. **Additional Credentials & Micro-Badges (NEW)**
2. **Entry Tests & Physicals (NEW)**
3. **BFET & Direct-Entry College On-Ramps (NEW)**
